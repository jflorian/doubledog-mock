# modules/mock/manifests/target.pp
#
# == Define: mock::target
#
# Installs a build-target configuration file for mock.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*namevar*]
#   An arbitrary identifier for the target instance.
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Instance is to be 'present' (default) or 'absent'.
#
# [*family*]
#   The build target's distribution family.  E.g., 'fedora' or 'epel'.
#
# [*release*]
#   The build target's distribution release.  E.g., '20'.
#
# [*target_arch*]
#   The machine hardware architecture that mock is to target when building
#   rpms.  This mostly affects code compilation.
#
# [*base_arch*]
#   The base architecture for the build target.  This affects mock's
#   configuration for yum repositories so that it can populate the build root
#   with the minimum package set plus all BuildRequires.
#
# [*legal_host_arches*]
#   To legally use this build target, the build host must be of a platform
#   architecture contained in this list.
